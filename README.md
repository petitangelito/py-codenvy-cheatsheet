=====================

My personal cheat sheet for coding in Python with Codenvy (cloud based IDE)

This project is a tutorial for coding with the cloud based IDE Codenvy and Google App Engine when you are already a standard Python developer (meaning with the command line interface). A simple example is adapted to run on this kind of architecture.

## Motivation

I am clearly a fan of Vim and I use it a lot to code in Python. This is a great tool. Unfortunately, that means that I cannot easily code when I am far from my Linux box. So I have investigated online IDE.

With Codenvy, you can code in Python. You cannot develop like on your laptop, the code has to be managed in a web framework. You can code whatever your want, you just have to take care of the user interface.

## Challenges

+ no print
+ a lot of OOP
+ data retention
+ module
+ threating

### Pricing

## Stone 0: "hello world!"

## Stone 1: "bonjour le monde!"

## Stone 2: first program

Use standard Python module
use str to cast as an integer + improve display

## Stone 3: loop step-by-step (data retention)

## Stone 4: log

## Stone 5: threaded loop (queue?)

## Stone 6: backend
