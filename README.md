py-codenvy-cheatsheet
=====================

My personal cheat sheet for coding in Python with Codenvy (cloud based IDE)

This project is a tutorial for coding with the cloud based IDE Codenvy and Google App Engine when you are already a standard Python developer (meaning with the command line interface). A simple example is adapted to run on this kind of architecture.

## Motivation

I am clearly a fan of Vim and I use a lot it to code in Python. This is a great tool. Unfortunately, that means that I cannot easily code when I am far from my Linux box.

## Challenges

+ no print
+ a lot of OOP
+ data retention
+ module
+ threating
